This repository contains supplementary material and information for the paper "Evaluation of an open-source chemical process simulator using a plant wide oil and gas separation plant flowsheet model as basis" by Anders Andreasen. 

The results in the paper are generated with process simulations for both DWSIM and Aspen HYSYS. The following simulation files are available in the `simulations/` folder:

* `Base_case_benchmark.dwxmz`, the main DWSIM simulation file for comparison with HYSYS
* `Black oil EOS density.hsc`, the HYSYS counterpart
* `optimisation.dwxmz`, the DWSIM simulation file used for the 100 case run parametric study, slightly modified version of the base case
* `Optim.hsc`, the HYSYS simulation file used for the 100 case run parametric study, slightly modified version of the base case
